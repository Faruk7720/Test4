Create a reprository
Back to my gitbash
Create a folder in the Desktop Farzeen2 by using mkdir command
I entered Farzeen2 folder that is in the desktop by using cd command. Command mean change directory, I know directory mean folder.
Then i create a test file name test.txt over the farzeen2 folder by using touch spach test.txt command.

I have to write somethong into the file. So i have to use vi command t0 go vi
edior. So i need use vi spach test.txt command.

I am happy to take learn from Rezaul bhai.

esc+shift+:+wq enter.[ This is save and exit command]

9.Now i have to upload test.txt file including folder to my git reprository.
    # This is the steps:
    1. git spach init
    2.git spach add-A
    3.git spach commit-m"first test"
    4.git spach remote spach add spach origin(paste the repository location
)
5.git spach push spach -u spach origin spach master
